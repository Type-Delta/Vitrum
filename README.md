# Vitrum

Means *glass* in Latin; because it is our concept. Glass is clear, right? So as **Vitrum**; it is a text editor which is minimal and user friendly yet full of features.

we designed **Vitrum** to be able to use as a small floating window, drop down menu is used to leave the main ui clean but menu would be easily accessible.

*Text sizes* and *whitespace* would be adjustible on the main ui, search system for *fonts*, also *tabs system* which allows you to open many files in one window.
