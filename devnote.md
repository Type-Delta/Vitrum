## Problems
- [x] **find didn't work** prob. somethings wrong with `find.ts: findAndReplaceText()`
- [x] **undo when replace text not working properly** Fix?: need to marge last history with unsaved history before replacing
- [x] **Actionmenu font search not working correctly** fix Tools.search()
- [x] **loading fonts tooltip (title) didn't go away after finish loading**
- [ ] **window flicker when moved quickly (on some device)**
- [ ] **thread got blocked for a second after finish loading fontlist**
- [x] **saving Editor state not working**
- [x] **actionmenu won't open when there're active editors**
- [x] **line wrap btn not working**
- [x] **restore editor state not working**
- [!] **editor is saved icon not working properly**
- [x] **the build app won't start**
      the suspect is `deferLoadDependencies()` other then that, I have NO idea T.T
      before [this commit](https://github.com/Type-Delta/Vitrum/commit/479fad3fb0a142393ba6136f1fed47ff3a92ab45) works
- [!] **when insert tab display area and interactive area not properly synced**
- [!] **actionmenu control not working properly**
- [ ] **some opened editors didn't save to state.json**
- [x] (#dm4k1) **displayarea f\**ked up... when displaying:** (different display area and interactive area scroll length?)
      ```js
      let dropdownItems = [...this.dropdownElement.children];
      let topIndex = 0;
      for(const sRes of filteredSearchRes){
            const matchElem = dropdownItems.find(e => e.children[1].textContent == sRes.string);
            if(matchElem){
                  if(matchElem.hidden) matchElem.hidden = false;
                  this.dropdownElement.insertBefore(
                        matchElem, dropdownItems[topIndex++]
                  );
                  continue;
            }
      }
      ```
      (edit) May also caused by display area having textwrap but interactive area didn't
- [!] **saving file and path not working properly**
- [!] **tab key doesn't work**
- [x] **OpenFile content not loaded**
- [!] **Fontloader sometimes picked up some trash**
- [!] **Replace ALL broke**
- [x] **scrollbar bug**
- [x] **typing single space at start doesn't produce any result in display area** could caused by how HTLM renders SPACE
- [ ] **when undo changes the cusor position will be set to one step older cusor position**
- [!] **when insert a NEWLINE char, sometimes will scroll down making the cusor sit on the top most visible line**
- [ ] **when placing long text, the program freeze for a bit**
- [!] **the program failed to restore it's last state**: have it saved it's state?, if so can it restore them?
- [q] **when scrolling to the very bottom: Editor's display and interactive area became out of sync**
      related to *#dm4k1*
      the cause is from the two element has a different `scrollHeight`.
      quick fixed by adding 2em more of bottom padding to the display area (@md3ia)
      this make their's `scrollHeight` close to the same
- [x] **zooming in (make font larger) too much make Editor's display and interactive area became out of sync**
      the display has somehow shift some line down while interactive doesn't?
      have someting to with text wrap of the display area?
      **Fixed:** turns out `<pre>` and `<code>` has `white-space: pre-wrap;` inside.
- [ ] **Ctrl key stuck after opening DevConsole**
- [ ] **when use tab insert it doesn't trigger History change**
